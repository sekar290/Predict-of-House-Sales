# Predict-of-House-Sales
Machine Learning using several algorithm

This is modelling that I did on House Sales Dataset to predict price of house sales in King Country, USA. This Dataset could be find through Kaggle

### ABOUT DATASET
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
The dataset contains categorical and numerical features with feature 'price' as the target.

**Note:**
- In here, I am trying to find out what's features could be effect on house price through Exploratory Data Analyst (EDA).
- Also, I tried several algorithm to get best model that could predict house price
